# README
This is my work for the very first project of the [Data Scientist Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) from Udacity.

### Disclaimer
I applied the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) in this repository, with one addition to the type list: `file`, used when I uploaded or changed non-coding files, like the charts' *.png.

I also used [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), hence the [Pipfile](https://github.com/mguidoti/DSND-p1-blog/blob/master/Pipfile) and [Pipfile.lock](https://github.com/mguidoti/DSND-p1-blog/blob/master/Pipfile.lock) in this repository.

```
In fact, I wrongly use files, in plural (commit 8fbda29).

## Motivation
Well, I have a PhD and I'm trying to break into the tech industry. With that being said, and, after [Josh Bernhard's Medium post on how to become a programmer](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711) where Josh analyzed the strategy people used to break into the field, I felt compelled to take a quick look on how sucessfull were the people that also have PhDs or any other doctoral degree - and perhaps more importantly, if their outcome have anything to do with their field of origin.

## Data
I used the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) in this project. It has around 60 different questions and almost 65000 respondents.

From their [own website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#overview):
> This year, rather than aiming to be the biggest, we set out to make our survey more representative of the diversity of programmers worldwide. That said, the survey is still big. This yearâ€™s survey was taken by nearly 65,000 people.

## Questions

## Libraries
- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/)
- [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

## Summary of Results

## Acknowledgements
Matplotlib documentation, StackOverflow (several questions) and [The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) helped me along the way.
